Rarities

Using a machine learning algorithm, all of the different identifying features of each work
have been analyzed
and ranked out of 10,000. From the amount of drips and splashes,
to the texture of the paint, each artwork has a unique combination of ranked features.

---

To identify the different characteristics that make each artwork unique,
we used something called a neural network.
The algorithm converts each pixel of the artwork into data,
translates this data into specific features of the work,
and compares the differences between the different works.

From the amount of drips and splashes, to the texture of the paint,
each artwork has a unique combination of ranked features.

Colors:
- Blues
- Reds
- Yellows
- Greens
- Magentas
- Blacks
- Whites

In this artwork 15.50% of the pixels are blues which ranks it 3619 out of 10,000. This means that 3618 artworks have fewer blue pixels and 6381 have more.

In this artwork 16.30% of the pixels are reds which ranks it 2367 out of 10,000. This means that 2366 artworks have fewer red pixels and 7633 have more.

**Colors**

On each artwork, the colour of every spot is unique. Even if two blue spots look similar, they will be different shades of blue. However, the colour rarity feature looks at each pixel of the artwork and classifies it into a colour group. We mapped 10,000 RGB values and divided them into 7 colour groups: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Magenta, Black, White.

The amount of coloured pixels are scored using a percentage, which indicates the percentage of pixels of that artwork that is a certain colour. The amount of each colour is also ranked out of 10,000.

For example, in the artwork 9038. My Art Gallery, we see 12% of the pixels are green which ranks it 6,304 out of 10,000. This means that 6,303 artworks have fewer green pixels and 3,697 have more.



Characteristics:
- Overlaps
- Drips
- Texture
- Density
- Weight

This artwork has an overlaps score of 0.38 which ranks it 999 out of 10,000. This means that 998 artworks have less overlaps and 9001 have more.

This artwork has a drips score of 0.43 which ranks it 4653 out of 10,000. This means that 4652 artworks have less drips and 5347 have more.

This artwork has a texture score of 0.38 which ranks it 693 out of 10,000. This means that 692 artworks have less texture and 9307 have more.


**Overlaps**
Although seemingly correlated, the overlaps and density features can be quite contrasting. Overlaps are classified as spots that sit on top of each other, partially or sometimes completely covering the paint underneath.

Overlaps are scored from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest value. A higher score means more overlaps.

An artwork with a high overlap score and a low density score, means that a high amount of the spots are touching but that they are clustered with blank paper between them.

For example, the artwork 3386. Represent The Past has an overlaps score of 0.00, ranking it just 1 out of 10,000. The artwork 9306. The Voices has an overlaps score of 1, which ranks it 10,000 out of 10,000.


**Density**

Density is classified as the amount of spots in close vicinity to each other. On some artworks, we see that spots are widely scattered across the paper, while other artworks show the spots tightly packed together.

Density is scored from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest value. A higher score means more density.

An artwork with a high density score and a low overlap score, means that the spots are very close together, but detached from one another.

For example, the artwork 9187. The Tearful Wheel has a density score of 0.00, ranking it 1 out of 10,000. The artwork 7936. Came On, Come On has a density score of 1, which ranks it 10,000 out of 10,000.


**Texture**

Each of the 10,000 The Currency tokens contain a high-resolution image of the front and the back of the artwork. These detailed images allow us to zoom in to the surface of the hand made paper and see the texture of the manually painted spots. Some spots are very clean and flat, while the paint on others is more wrinkled and thick.

Texture is scored from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest value. A higher score means that the paint has more texture.

For example, in the artwork 2329. Let The World Tremble, we see a texture score 0.42 which ranks it 1,221 out of 10,000. This means that 1,220 artworks have less texture and 8,779 have more.

**Drips**

Dispensing the rules of the renowned spot paintings, known for their perfect circles in a grid format, Damien Hirst allowed the works of The Currency to become more organic. Free from restraint, these hand painted spots produced spontaneous imperfections and asymmetries. These irregularities can be found as small specks of paint, splashes, or trails, which we have classified as drips.

Drips are scored from 0 to 1, with 1 being the highest value. A higher score means more drips.

For example, the artwork 2979. There Isn't Time To Sit Down has a drips score of 0.08, ranking it just 2 out of 10,000. The artwork 8092. Nobody Lives Like You has a drips score of 1, which ranks it 10,000 out of 10,000.

**Weight**

Each of the 10,000 artworks have been individually weighed upon completion, to a precision of 0.01 grams. The subtle differences in the thickness of the paint, the amount of spots, and even the length of the handwritten title influence the weight of each work. The weights may change over time due to atmospheric conditions such as humidity

The score for weight is the amount of grams that an artwork weighs. Each of these scores is also ranked out of 10,000. In some cases, artworks have an identical weight. In these cases, they have a shared rank out of 10,000.

For example, the artwork 5022. Good To Get A Kiss has a weight of 13.84 grams, ranking it 2 out of 10,000. The artwork 6528. In The Interest Of Playing Along has a weight of 24.34 grams, which ranks it 9,995 out of 10,000.


**Other rarities**

The rarity features described above are included in the token metadata on IPFS. However, they are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the rarities. For example, there are a small number of tokens with particularly long streaks of paint running across them.
